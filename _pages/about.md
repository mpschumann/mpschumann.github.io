I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Hertie School's Centre for International Security](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/schumann). I study the intersection of communication technology, state repression, and political violence. My dissertation examines internet legislation in authoritarian regimes.
